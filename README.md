# Blog

Just a personal blog , where I share random things. Will update or write posts whenever I can.

## About The Blog

This is a space where I write about things that matter to me. Every post here is entirely written by me, from my own perspective and experiences. This is not AI-generated content, and posts are not copied or adapted from other sources. 

Think of it as a digital collection of my thoughts, observations, learnings, and things I want to share with the world. They maybe useless, they maybe useful, basically it's just a space where I share my perspectives. 

The content throughout the blog is presented in the first person to provide a direct and personal narrative.

## Technology

- Astro - A modern web framework for content-driven websites. [Check out here for more info](https://astro.build/)
