## What This Means in Plain English

This is a **Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License**. Here's what that actually means for you and anyone who reads my blog:

---

## What You CAN Do

- **Read and share blog posts** - Copy them, email them to friends, post them on social media, link to them
- **Republish posts** - Share them on other websites, blogs, newsletters, or platforms
- **Use them commercially** - Include my posts in paid courses, sell access, use in commercial projects
- **Translate them** - Put my posts in other languages (that's cool!)

**The only requirement:** You must give credit to author and link back to the original post

---

## What You CANNOT Do

- **Modify or edit my posts** - Don't change authors words, remove sections, rewrite paragraphs
- **Create new versions** - Don't create "improved" or "updated" versions of authors posts
- **Remix or adapt them** - Don't combine authors post with other content to create something new
- **Claim them as your own** - Always give credit to the original author

---

## If You Share My Content

When you share, republish, or reuse my posts, you must:

- **Keep authors name and credit author** - Say who wrote it
- **Link back** - Include a link to the original post on my blog
- **Keep the license notice** - Let people know it's under CC BY-ND 4.0
- **Don't claim you created it** - Be honest about the original author

---

## Important Stuff

  - **No warranty** - My posts are shared "as-is". I don't guarantee they're perfect or error-free
  - **No liability** - I'm not responsible if something goes wrong from reading my content
  - **This is permanent** - Once I license my content this way, I can't take it back
  - **If you break the rules** - Your permission to share automatically ends, but you get 30 days to fix it

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use blog posts in my article/blog/social media?**  
A: Yes, as long as you give credit to author and link back to the original.

**Q: Can I fix typos in your post when I share it?**  
A: No. Share it as-is. If there are typos, I'll fix them on my blog.

**Q: Can I translate your post?**  
A: Yes! But just credit the author and link to the original.

**Q: Can I take your ideas and write my own version?**  
A: That's fine - that's not a "derivative". But if you're copying my actual words and just rewording them, that's creating an adaptation, which isn't allowed.

**Q: What if I violate this license?**  
A: Your permission to share my content automatically ends. You'd need to stop sharing it.
